#Simons Diversity Project

We are hosting data from the [Simon's Diversity Project](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/).

The data hosted here represent alignments to GRCh38 generated using our standard pipeline.

We also point to the open raw data stored in the Sequence and Variation archives


##Use of the genome sequence data (Please respect Fort Lauderdale principles)

All data are made freely available. However, please observe the Fort Lauderdale principles, which entitle the data producers to make the first presentation and publish the first genome-wide analysis of the data. The data can be used freely for studies of individual genes or other individual features of the genome.

If you have any questions about using the data please email info@1000genomes.org
