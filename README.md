# 1000Genomes_data_indexes

This git repo has been setup to store and track sequence index files and other data index files created for data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Currently this repo is being used to track the sequence data generated for the 1000 Genomes SV group project to assay three trios to establish a high quality SV map for each genome. Please note the data reuse conditions which are associated with these indexes. These indexes can be found in the [sv_discovery_indexes](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/tree/master/sv_discovery_indexes)


For any questions about this repo please either open an issue or email info@1000genomes.org
