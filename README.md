# 1000Genomes_data_indexes

This git repo has been setup to store and track sequence index files and other data index files created for data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Currently this repo is being used to track the sequence data generated for the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium to assay three trios to establish a high quality SV map for each genome. Please note there are data reuse conditions which are associated with these indexes. These indexes and the data reuse conditions can be found in the [sv_discovery_indexes](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/tree/master/sv_discovery_indexes)

Our new project readmes will also be stored in this repo under the [docs](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/tree/master/docs) directory.

For any questions about this repo please either open an issue or email info@1000genomes.org
