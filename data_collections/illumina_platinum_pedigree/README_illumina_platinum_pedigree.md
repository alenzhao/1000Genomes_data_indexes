#Illumina Platinum Pedigree README

This README contains information relating to data associated with the Illumina Platinum pedigree data set, files for which are available under this directory.

###The Illumina Platinum pedigree data set

Information about the Platinum pedigree data is available from [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/).

Illumina states:
>"If you have any questions, contact us at: platinumgenomes@illumina.com. Please note that while Platinum Genomes are freely available, Illumina does not offer technical support for these resources. Please cite this website and Illumina, Inc. in publications and other public usage of Platinum Genomes."

The pedigree sequence data was generated on the 17 member CEPH pedigree 1463 and includes a technical replicate of NA12882. The technical replicate is labelled as NA12882_2.

Additional description can be found in the [ENA entry for this project](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP001960).

###Alignment of the pedigree data to the reference genome

The alignment data can be found under this directory and is organised by population and then sample name (with both replicates present in the NA12882 directory). 

Under each sample, the alignment directory contains alignments generated by aligning the data with bwa mem to a reference genome comprising GRCh38, the HLA sequnces and decoy sequences. This uses the alt aware approach described here:
[https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/master/README-alt.md](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/master/README-alt.md)

Additional information on the alternative sequences that are part of GRCh38 can be found here:
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/human/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/human/)

###Alignment availability

The alignments have been made available in CRAM format. Additional information on CRAM can be found in a dedicated README at the toplevel of this site. Further information is available at these locations:
