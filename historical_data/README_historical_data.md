#README for historical_data directory

This directory was created as part of a reorganisation of the 1000 Genomes Project/IGSR FTP site in September 2015. The purpose of the reorgansiation of the site is to support the transition from the 1000 Genomes Project to the IGSR and reflect the changes in the data being hosted on the site.

To provide continuity, this directory was created to hold files previously held at the top level of the FTP site. As of September 2015, the files in this directory are not being actively maintained but have been placed here so that they remain available to users for reference.

For current information, please consult the [current files in the top level of the site](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes) along with the files associated with the data sets. 

Should you have any queries, please contact info@1000genomes.org.
