#International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) Data Disclaimer

IGSR provides access to a variety of data from many projects. No restrictions on access or use of this data are imposed by IGSR, although some data may be subject to third party constraints.

Users should be aware that constraints may vary from project to project, by data type within a project or in any other way. It is the sole responsibility of the user to establish the nature of and comply with any restrictions placed on specific items of data within IGSR.

Data from the 1000 Genomes Project is freely available without embargo, following the final publication from the project. Use of the data should be cited in the usual way, with current details available at  [http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/how-do-i-cite-1000-genomes-project](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/how-do-i-cite-1000-genomes-project).

Data from the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) continues the philosophy of the 1000 Genomes Project, making data available prior to publication in line with Fort Lauderdale principles, allowing others to use the data but allowing the data producers to make the first presentations and to publish the first paper with global analyses of the data. For further details, users should see the [data reuse statement](https://github.com/igsr/1000Genomes_data_indexes/blob/master/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/README_hgsvc_datareuse_statement.md) accompanying the data.

Where the data use and access policy of a project has been made known to IGSR, information on that policy will be provided by IGSR with the data, however, IGSR can take no responsibility for the information being either current or accurate.

All data and information, including any project data access or use statements, are provided by the [EMBL](http://www.embl.org) - [European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) in good faith, but EMBL - EBI make no warranty, express or implied, nor assume any legal liability or responsibility for any purpose for which they are used.
